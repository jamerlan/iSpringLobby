iSpringLobby
============

Intellij Idea based Spring RTS lobby client (written in java)


Other lobby clients are good too:<br/>







but:<br/>
1) They have no filtering in most cases<br/>
2) Auto complete is not very good<br/>
3) Slowly developed (bugs are not fixed for long time periods)<br/>
4) Not really cross platform 5) Looks bad (especially layout)<br/>
5) Lacking hotkeys<br/>
