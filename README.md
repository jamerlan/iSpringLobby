iSpringLobby
============

Intellij Idea based Spring RTS lobby client (written in java)


Other lobby clients are good too:







but:
1) They have no filtering in most cases
2) Auto complete is not very good
3) Slowly developed (bugs are not fixed for long time periods)
4) Not really cross platform 5) Looks bad (especially layout)
5) Lacking hotkeys
